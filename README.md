## How the game works:
This game uses wpm to determain speed, wpm stands simply for "words per minute" and is used to descripe
how fast a user can type. Typing speed can always be improved by the more you play. Once you enter the website you will
see some randomized words pop up in a screen. Below this screen is an input field where you can start the test. Once the
timer hits 0 it will automatically stop the game and display your results.

##  step 4:
  Start typing these words and you will notice a timer ticking slowly down. Try to type as many words as you can in these 15 seconds. After that you notice a pop up, thats your stats. 

##  step 5:
  If you want to play again you can press tab or the "try again" button. Above the input field you will also notice a "custom timer" option, use this if you feel like 15 seconds isn't a enough time for you.

##  10/14/2024
  Made a figma template that displays my vision for redtype. I usually use Premier XD, but unfortunately they have shut down so I had to use Figma. It was kinda advanced at first sight, but I got the hang of it now. I also made a Github Repository and a Kanban board

##  10/15/2024
  I started by today, making a Redtype logo. This wasn't necessary at all in this project, but I was having the Photoshop energy. I felt like this logo was good, but when I asked other classmates they disagreed so I think have to remove or change it at some point. I then decided to make a webside and fucused on the front part of the website, where I made the navbar and a few other components.

##  10/16/2024 - 10/17/2024
   on the 16th and 17th of october I started directly on the main process of making the game. I liked monkeytype's design and took inspiration to creat the main game in the middle of the screen (https://monkeytype.com). I decided to make the main colors grey and red since its a good match of contrast and its overall a unic design.Today I learned using flask and connected it with the website, now I can use python, sql along with HTML, CSS and javascript. I also coded inn some basic python that makes randome words pop up on the screen. This also automaticly regenerate each time you refresh the website. The python script was simply done by using the randit command that can selects words from a list. The hard part was to understand and connect CSS, javascript and the images using python. HTML is no longer the main template that decides the connections.


##  10/19/2024
  Using javascript today I made the user able to type the words that appeared on the screen. I did this by using javascript catch the user input and then check if the input matches with the displayed word. I used internett and ai tools like chatGPT since I didn't know how to make this happen. ChatGPT explaind very well to me and I now know how to use the DOM element in javascript.

## 10/20/2024 - 10/23/2024
  During these days I was able to make the base of the game that includs things like a character counter and a word counter for every word that was correct. Using the characters I was able to make a WPM counter using the WPM formula (https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Words-Per-Minute). After that I used some time to focus on the frontend to make a better display for the users to see their stats I also made a simple timer for 15 secounds.

## 10/24/2024 - 10/28/2024
  Fixed elements to be more sematrical and added more webside pages for  leaderboard, about us, settings and profile. Also started on a custom time button if the user want to add changes to their basic time. For the upcoming days I worked mainly with the small details of the webside.

## 11/4/2024 - 11/5/2024
  Used this time to preper for the feature by updating and adding new things to the kanban board. I now have a vision for what to do in the next upcoming weeks. 

## 11/6/2024 - 11/10/2024
  These days I took a break from coding and started learning something new like apache, nginx, advanced flask, mysql, etc. I than started to learn how to make my website public. I used apache on the beginning, but later moved over to nginx because I learned that nginx is more resource-efficient and gives better performance than Apache. I port forwarded port 80 and port 443 to nginx and now using my public I was able to view my website. I then used cloudflare (www.cloudflare.com) to change the dns to www.redtype.Jasan.top

## 11/11/2024 - 11/14/2024
  Added a coockies feature to the webside, since I am planning to make a login feature I need to add cookies. Cookies on a webside is what saves the login session so the user don't have to repeatly login after a reload. I wanted to start by making a pop up for the first time visitors. I used local storage to make this happen and during this process I didn't recive any errors fortunately.
