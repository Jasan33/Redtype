# Welcome to Redtype
The offcial Redtype website

In this website, you can test your word typing speed, compete with others, check your globally ranking and imporove your typing.

Typing is both useful and fun for everyone!

How the game works:
This game uses wpm to determain speed, it stands for "words per minute" and it used to descripe
how fast someone can type. Typing speed can be improved by the more you play. In this game you
will see some randome words pop up infront of you and you have to type them correctly in the
input field downbelow. Once the countdown reaches 0 it will display your stat.

  On the first day I started by making a Redtype logo, then fucussed on the front end of the website, where I made the navbar and a few other components. i also made a list of things that I planned on addeing to the website.

  On this wednesday I created multiple samples of the redtype logo just in case it needed a change, then I started directly on the main process of making the game. I liked monkeytype's design and took inspiration to creat the main game in the middle of the screen (https://monkeytype.com). I decided to make the main colors grey and red since its a good match of contrast both and its overall a unik usage.

  Today I learned using flask and connected it with the website, now I can use python, sql along with HTML, CSS and javascript. I later added some basic python code that makes random words appear on the screen each time you enter the website. This was done using the randit script that selects one from a list of words. The hard part was to connect CSS, javascript and the images with python. HTML is no longer the main boss that decides the connections between each language.

  Using javascript today I made the user able to type the words that appeared on the screen. This wasn't hard as I expected, all I had to do was make the javascript able to catch the user input and then check if the input matches with the displayed word. I needed to use a bit of chatGPT since I didn't know how to make this happen at a instant. ChatGPT explaind very well to me and I now know what DOM does.

  The website now has a word and character counter. Adding the word counter wasn't tough, all the javascript had to do was add one on the counter each time the word user entered was correct. the character counter on the other hand was a bit hard to solve, but it turns out that I just needed the user inputs lenght after each correct word. Also connected it with HTML so it displays these stats during the test.
