### How the game works:
This game uses wpm to determain speed, wpm stands simply for "words per minute" and is used to descripe
how fast a user can type. Typing speed can always be improved by the more you play. Once you enter the website you will
see some randomized words pop up in a screen. Below this screen is an input field where you can start the test. Once the
timer hits 0 it will automatically stop the game and display your results.

# Project started at 10/14/2024


##  10/14/2024
  From the beginning of the projct I started by writing down some notes and making a kanban board of the plan. I later started by making a Redtype logo. I then decided to make a webside and fucused on the front part of the website, where I made the navbar and a few other components.

  On this wednesday I created multiple samples of the redtype logo just in case it needed a change, then I started directly on the main process of making the game. I liked monkeytype's design and took inspiration to creat the main game in the middle of the screen (https://monkeytype.com). I decided to make the main colors grey and red since its a good match of contrast and its overall a unic design.

  Today I learned using flask and connected it with the website, now I can use python, sql along with HTML, CSS and javascript. I also coded inn some basic python that makes randome words pop up on the screen. This also automaticly regenerate each time you refresh the website. The python script was simply done by using the randit command that can select one from a list of words. The hard part was to connect CSS, javascript and the images with python. HTML is no longer the main boss that decides the connections.

##  10/19/2024
  Using javascript today I made the user able to type the words that appeared on the screen. I expected this to be a extreme task, but it actully wasn't so advanced. All I had to do was make the javascript able to catch the user input and then check if the input matches with the displayed word. I used internett and ai tools like chatGPT since I didn't know how to make this happen at a instant. ChatGPT explaind very well to me and I now know how to use the DOM in javascript.

  The website now has a word and character counter. Adding the word counter wasn't tough, all the javascript had to do was add one on the counter each time the word user entered was correct. the character counter on the other hand was a bit hard to solve, but it turns out that I just needed the user inputs lenght after each correct word. Also connected it with HTML so it displays these stats during the test.

##  10/21/2024
  Today I made the total stats appear on a display screen after each attampt. This screen is avaliale as soon as the timer of the test runs out. It diaplys all the information and it also tells the user their WPN (words per minute). The WPM formula is pretty straight forward, its caracters divided by 5 and then divied that by the time usage in minutes. I still need to make the frontend version for this display, but atleast the backend part works so far

##  10/23/2024
  On this day I decided to take a break from the backend coding part and fucused more on the frontend part. I designed serveral things all around the websided, but kept it mostly on the display menu. It now has a better view by blurring the backround, adding an     
aditional hover effect and loads in with a 0.5 cooldown to smooth it in.
