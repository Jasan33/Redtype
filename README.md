# Welcome to Redtype
The offcial Redtype website

In this website, you can test your word typing speed, compete with others, check your globally ranking and imporove your typing.

Typing is both useful and fun for everyone!

How the game works:
This game uses wpm to determain speed, it stands for "words per minute" and it used to descripe
how fast someone can type. Typing speed can be improved by the more you play. In this game you
will see some randome words pop up infront of you and you have to type them correctly in the
input field downbelow. Once the countdown reaches 0 it will display your stat.

  started with making a Redtype logo (with a few samples)  then I started directly on the main process of making the game
  I liked the monkeytype's design and took inspiration to great the main game in the middle of the screen. I decided to make the main colors grey and red since its a good match of contrast both comfortable for the eye and for the view.

  today I learned using flask and connected it with the website, now I can use python, sql along with HTML, CSS and JS. I latter made added basic python to give random words appear each time you enter the website, using the import randit. The hard part was to connect      CSS, js and the images with python. HTML is no longer the main boss that decides the connections between each language.

  using js I made user type the words that wear displayed on the screen. This wasn't as hard as I expected I just needed js to catch the user input and then check if it matches the display words. I needed to use a bit of chatGPT since I didn't know how to make this        happen at a fast speed. ChatGPT explaind very well what DOM does.

  The website now has a word and character counter. Adding the word counter wasn't hard I just needed to add 1 each time the word user entered was correct. the character counter on the other hand was a bit tuff but it turns how I just needed the user inputs lenght after   each correct word. Also made it capable with HTML so it displays some stats during a test.
